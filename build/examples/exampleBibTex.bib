	abstract = {The Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) functions in bacteria as a contractile nanomachine that punctures and delivers lethal effectors to a target cell. Virtually nothing is known about the lifestyle or physiology that dictates when bacteria normally produce their T6SS, which prevents a clear understanding of how bacteria benefit from its action in their natural habitat. Proteus mirabilis undergoes a characteristic developmental process to coordinate a multicellular swarming behavior and will discriminate itself from another Proteus isolate during swarming, resulting in a visible boundary termed a Dienes line. Using transposon mutagenesis, we discovered that this recognition phenomenon requires the lethal action of the T6SS. All mutants identified in the genetic screen had insertions within a single 33.5-kb region that encodes a T6SS and cognate Hcp-VrgG-linked effectors. The identified T6SS and primary effector operons were characterized by killing assays, by construction of additional mutants, by complementation, and by examining the activity of the type VI secretion system in real-time using live-cell microscopy on opposing swarms. We show that lethal T6SS-dependent activity occurs when a dominant strain infiltrates deeply beyond the boundary of the two swarms. Using this multicellular model, we found that social recognition in bacteria, underlying killing, and immunity to killing all require cell-cell contact, can be assigned to specific genes, and are dependent on the T6SS. The ability to survive a lethal T6SS attack equates to “recognition”. In contrast to the current model of T6SS being an offensive or defensive weapon our findings support a preemptive mechanism by which an entire population indiscriminately uses the T6SS for contact-dependent delivery of effectors during its cooperative mode of growth., Bacterial Type VI Secretion Systems (T6SS) function as contractile nanomachines to puncture target cells and deliver lethal effectors. Little is known about the lifestyle or physiology dictating when bacteria normally express their T6SS. Proteus mirabilis undergoes a characteristic developmental process to coordinate multicellular swarming behavior and discriminates itself from other Proteus isolates during swarming, by a visible boundary termed a Dienes line. We report this phenomenon, first noted in 1946, requires the lethal action of the T6SS, T6SS-dependent effectors, and immunity proteins. T6SS-mediated lethality is unique to morphologically distinct swarmer cells, and when it occurs requires direct contact. Using this multicellular system, we report that the pre-formed T6SS strikes neighboring cells upon cell-cell contact. Our findings support a preemptive mechanism by which an entire population indiscriminately uses the T6SS during a cooperative behavior and that social recognition in bacteria is immunity to lethal T6SS attack.},

	abstract = {The pathogen Campylobacter jejuni is the principal cause of bacterial food-borne infections. The mechanism(s) that contribute to bacterial survival and disease are still poorly understood. In other bacterial species, type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are increasingly recognized to contribute to bacterial pathogenesis by toxic effects on host cells or competing bacterial species. Here we report the presence of a functional Type VI secretion system in C. jejuni. Proteome and genetic analyses revealed that C. jejuni strain 108 contains a 17-kb T6SS gene cluster consisting of 13 T6SS-conserved genes, including the T6SS hallmark genes hcp and vgrG. The cluster lacks an ortholog of the ClpV ATPase considered important for T6SS function. The sequence and organization of the C. jejuni T6SS genes resemble those of the T6SS located on the HHGI1 pathogenicity island of Helicobacter hepaticus. The C. jejuni T6SS is integrated into the earlier acquired Campylobacter integrated element CJIE3 and is present in about 10\% of C. jejuni isolates including several isolates derived from patients with the rare clinical feature of C. jejuni bacteremia. Targeted mutagenesis of C. jejuni T6SS genes revealed T6SS-dependent secretion of the Hcp needle protein into the culture supernatant. Infection assays provided evidence that the C. jejuni T6SS confers contact-dependent cytotoxicity towards red blood cells but not macrophages. This trait was observed only in a capsule-deficient bacterial phenotype. The unique C. jejuni T6SS phenotype of capsule-sensitive contact-mediated hemolysis represents a novel evolutionary pathway of T6SS in bacteria and expands the repertoire of virulence properties associated with T6SS., Bacteria contain a number of secretion systems to export macromolecules to the environment. The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) forms a needle-like structure that delivers toxic effector molecules to neighboring eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cells. Here we report that the important human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni contains a functional T6SS gene cluster. The cluster comprises 13 conserved T6SS genes including genes encoding the typical T6SS Hcp and VgrG proteins. The gene cluster is part of a larger DNA element and is present in about 10\% of C. jejuni strains including several blood isolates. The identified C. jejuni T6SS has unique properties compared to similar systems in other bacterial species. C. jejuni T6SS lacks the ClpV ATPase that supposedly energizes part of T6SS function in other species, causes contact-dependent lysis of red blood cells, and requires downregulation of the C. jejuni capsule polysaccharide to be effective. The unique cytotoxic properties of C. jejuni T6SS, the effect of the capsule on T6SS function, and the possible association with systemic C. jejuni infection broaden the scope of the existing bacterial T6SS phenotypes and point to a different evolution of C. jejuni T6SS compared to other bacterial species.},

	abstract = {The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread protein secretion system found in many Gram-negative bacteria. T6SSs are highly regulated by various regulatory systems at multiple levels, including post-translational regulation via threonine (Thr) phosphorylation. The Ser/Thr protein kinase PpkA is responsible for this Thr phosphorylation regulation, and the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain-containing Fha-family protein is the sole T6SS phosphorylation substrate identified to date. Here we discovered that TssL, the T6SS inner-membrane core component, is phosphorylated and the phosphorylated TssL (p-TssL) activates type VI subassembly and secretion in a plant pathogenic bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Combining genetic and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that TssL is phosphorylated at Thr 14 in a PpkA-dependent manner. Further analysis revealed that the PpkA kinase activity is responsible for the Thr 14 phosphorylation, which is critical for the secretion of the T6SS hallmark protein Hcp and the putative toxin effector Atu4347. TssL phosphorylation is not required for the formation of the TssM-TssL inner-membrane complex but is critical for TssM conformational change and binding to Hcp and Atu4347. Importantly, Fha specifically interacts with phosphothreonine of TssL via its pThr-binding motif in vivo and in vitro and this interaction is crucial for TssL interaction with Hcp and Atu4347 and activation of type VI secretion. In contrast, pThr-binding ability of Fha is dispensable for TssM structural transition. In conclusion, we discover a novel Thr phosphorylation event, in which PpkA phosphorylates TssL to activate type VI secretion via its direct binding to Fha in A. tumefaciens. A model depicting an ordered TssL phosphorylation-induced T6SS assembly pathway is proposed., The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) resembles a contractile phage tail structure and functions to deliver effectors to eukaryotic or prokaryotic target cells for the survival of many pathogenic bacteria. T6SS is highly regulated by various regulatory systems at multiple levels in response to environmental cues. Post-translational regulation via threonine (Thr) phosphorylation is an emerging theme in regulating prokaryotic signaling, including T6SS; the knowledge is mainly contributed by studies of Hcp secretion island 1-encoded T6SS (H1-T6SS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we discover a new phosphorylated target, a T6SS core-component TssL, and demonstrate that this Thr phosphorylation event post-translationally regulates type VI secretion in a plant pathogenic bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We provide the first demonstration that the specific binding of Fha, a forkhead-associated domain-containing protein, to the phosphorylated target is required to stimulate type VI secretion. Genetic and biochemical data strongly suggest an ordered TssL-phosphorylation–dependent assembly and secretion pathway.},

	abstract = {Crystal structures of type VI secretion system-associated immunity proteins, a peptidoglycan endopeptidase and a complex of the endopeptidase and its cognate immunity protein are reported together with assays of endopeptidase activity and functional assessment., Some Gram-negative bacteria target their competitors by exploiting the type VI secretion system to extrude toxic effector proteins. To prevent self-harm, these bacteria also produce highly specific immunity proteins that neutralize these antagonistic effectors. Here, the peptidoglycan endopeptidase specificity of two type VI secretion-system-associated effectors from Serratia marcescens is characterized. These small secreted proteins, Ssp1 and Ssp2, cleave between γ-d-glutamic acid and l-meso-diaminopimelic acid with different specificities. Ssp2 degrades the acceptor part of cross-linked tetratetrapeptides. Ssp1 displays greater promiscuity and cleaves monomeric tripeptides, tetrapeptides and pentapeptides and dimeric tetratetra and tetrapenta muropeptides on both the acceptor and donor strands. Functional assays confirm the identity of a catalytic cysteine in these endopeptidases and crystal structures provide information on the structure–activity relationships of Ssp1 and, by comparison, of related effectors. Functional assays also reveal that neutralization of these effectors by their cognate immunity proteins, which are called resistance-associated proteins (Raps), contributes an essential role to cell fitness. The structures of two immunity proteins, Rap1a and Rap2a, responsible for the neutralization of Ssp1 and Ssp2-like endopeptidases, respectively, revealed two distinct folds, with that of Rap1a not having previously been observed. The structure of the Ssp1–Rap1a complex revealed a tightly bound heteromeric assembly with two effector molecules flanking a Rap1a dimer. A highly effective steric block of the Ssp1 active site forms the basis of effector neutralization. Comparisons with Ssp2–Rap2a orthologues suggest that the specificity of these immunity proteins for neutralizing effectors is fold-dependent and that in cases where the fold is conserved sequence differences contribute to the specificity of effector–immunity protein interactions.},

	abstract = {The Vibrio cholerae type VI secretion system (T6SS) assembles as a molecular syringe that injects toxic protein effectors into both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. We previously reported that the V. cholerae O37 serogroup strain V52 maintains a constitutively active T6SS to kill other Gram-negative bacteria while being immune to attack by kin bacteria. The pandemic O1 El Tor V. cholerae strain C6706 is T6SS-silent under laboratory conditions as it does not produce T6SS structural components and effectors, and fails to kill Escherichia coli prey. Yet, C6706 exhibits full resistance when approached by T6SS-active V52. These findings suggested that an active T6SS is not required for immunity against T6SS-mediated virulence. Here, we describe a dual expression profile of the T6SS immunity protein-encoding genes tsiV1, tsiV2, and tsiV3 that provides pandemic V. cholerae strains with T6SS immunity and allows T6SS-silent strains to maintain immunity against attacks by T6SS-active bacterial neighbors. The dual expression profile allows transcription of the three genes encoding immunity proteins independently of other T6SS proteins encoded within the same operon. One of these immunity proteins, TsiV2, protects against the T6SS effector VasX which is encoded immediately upstream of tsiV2. VasX is a secreted, lipid-binding protein that we previously characterized with respect to T6SS-mediated virulence towards the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Our data suggest the presence of an internal promoter in the open reading frame of vasX that drives expression of the downstream gene tsiV2. Furthermore, VasX is shown to act in conjunction with VasW, an accessory protein to VasX, to compromise the inner membrane of prokaryotic target cells. The dual regulatory profile of the T6SS immunity protein-encoding genes tsiV1, tsiV2, and tsiV3 permits V. cholerae to tightly control T6SS gene expression while maintaining immunity to T6SS activity., 
Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera. This bacterium uses the type VI secretion system (T6SS) to kill other bacteria and host cells. The T6SS is a molecular syringe that Gram-negative bacteria use to inject toxic effectors into target cells in a contact-dependent manner. The V. cholerae T6SS secretes at least three distinct effectors, VasX, TseL, and VgrG-3 to confer antimicrobial activity. To protect itself from an oncoming attack by neighboring bacteria, V. cholerae produces three immunity proteins, TsiV1, TsiV2, and TsiV3 that specifically inactivate the activity of their respective effectors. We determined that the genes encoding TsiV1, TsiV2, and TsiV3 are controlled in a dual fashion that ensures expression of these genes at all times. This provides V. cholerae with constant protection from a T6SS attack by nearby close relatives. Thus, the T6SS gene cluster is a toxin/immunity system that can both kill and protect bacterial cells. Here, we characterize the mechanism of one T6SS effector, VasX, that disrupts the inner membrane of susceptible bacteria. The immunity protein TsiV2 protects prokaryotic cells against VasX-mediated toxicity.},

	abstract = {The structure of the Tse3–Tsi3 complex associated with the bacterial type VI secretion system of P. aeruginosa has been solved and refined at 1.9 Å resolution. The structural basis of the recognition of the muramidase effector and its inactivation by its cognate immunity protein is revealed., The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a bacterial protein-export machine that is capable of delivering virulence effectors between Gram-negative bacteria. The T6SS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transports two lytic enzymes, Tse1 and Tse3, to degrade cell-wall peptidoglycan in the periplasm of rival bacteria that are competing for niches via amidase and muramidase activities, respectively. Two cognate immunity proteins, Tsi1 and Tsi3, are produced by the bacterium to inactivate the two antibacterial effectors, thereby protecting its siblings from self-intoxication. Recently, Tse1–Tsi1 has been structurally characterized. Here, the structure of the Tse3–Tsi3 complex is reported at 1.9 Å resolution. The results reveal that Tse3 contains a C-terminal catalytic domain that adopts a soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) fold in which three calcium-binding sites were surprisingly observed close to the catalytic Glu residue. The electrostatic properties of the substrate-binding groove are also distinctive from those of known structures with a similar fold. All of these features imply that a unique catalytic mechanism is utilized by Tse3 in cleaving glycosidic bonds. Tsi3 comprises a single domain showing a β-sandwich architecture that is reminiscent of the immunoglobulin fold. Three loops of Tsi3 insert deeply into the groove of Tse3 and completely occlude its active site, which forms the structural basis of Tse3 inactivation. This work is the first crystallographic report describing the three-dimensional structure of the Tse3–Tsi3 effector–immunity pair.},
